> ## Excerpt
> Boost your productivity by learning how to use advanced search with Jira Query Language (JQL) in Jira Service Management.

The advanced search is the most powerful and flexible way toÂ search for your issues in Jira. You can use the Jira Query Language (JQL) to specify criteria that cannot be defined in the quick or basic searches. For example, you can use the ORDER BY clause in a JQL query to search for issues and display them in an ascending or descending order.

JQL is for everyone: developers, testers, [agile project managers](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/agile-project-management "https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/agile-project-management"), and business users. However, you need to know how to construct structured queries using JQL to use this feature.
